**PaymentModule**
****
**🌐 Project Overview**

This project presents a full-featured payment gateway simulation, built using modern architectural principles and best practices across both backend and frontend.

It includes a robust Payment Module designed with event-driven architecture to efficiently process transactions, seamlessly integrate with a simulated third-party API, and handle asynchronous events such as transaction status updates — all while ensuring reliability, scalability, and resilience.

**This Project Consists of:**
** **
**1. PaymentGatewayMockAPI** — A mock third-party payment API to simulate real-world payment processing.

**2. PaymentGatewayWebAPI** – Main backend API handling payment processing, idempotency, transaction logging, and event publishing.

**3. Event-Driven Architecture** — Utilizes RabbitMQ for asynchronous message handling between services.

**4. Authentication & Authorization** — Implements secure user identity management using **JWT-based access and refresh tokens**, ensuring safe and seamless authentication throughout the application.

**5. Logging** — Integrated Serilog for structured and detailed application logs.

**6. Global Exception Handling** — Centralized error handling for consistent API responses.

**7. Retry Policy** — Implements automatic retries using Polly to handle transient failures.

**8. Idempotency Support** — Prevents duplicate payment processing through idempotent request handling.

**9. PaymentGatewayApp (Angular)** — Frontend client built with Angular, supporting secure token management, form submission, and graceful error handling.

**10. Unit Testing** – Includes backend unit tests using xUnit, covering core services and controller logic to ensure reliability.

**11. CORS Support** – Enables secure cross-origin requests between frontend (Angular) and backend (.NET API).

**12. Rate Limiting** – Applies IP-based request limits using Fixed Window strategy to prevent API overuse. Allows 1 request per minute with 1 queued request, returning HTTP 429 when exceeded.

**13. Database Seed Service** – Initializes the database with default user records on application startup. Helps automate setup for development, testing, or first-time deployments.

**⚙️ How to Set Up This Solution :**

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. Restore all backend dependencies using your IDE or .NET CLI.

3. Update configuration files (appsettings.json) :

 - Database connection string

 - RabbitMQ credentials

 - Serilog logging settings

4. Build and run the .NET solution to automatically create the database and required tables.

5. Install frontend dependencies in the Angular project.

6. Build and run the Angular application 

7. Access the application in your browser and begin testing.
